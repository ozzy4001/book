# Brand Identity

## Logo

The GS SHOP logotype is set in Whitney Bold. As the typeface used by all other GS brands, Whitney connects us to our roots while also allowing our new identity and graphic element to stand out. The GS SHOP logo has been designed to be legible in all sizes and mediums. Used correctly, our logo will become a visual signifier of the GS SHOP brand in all of our materials.

#### Writing GS SHOP

When the GS SHOP name appears in body copy, it should always be written in all capital letters.

## Symbol : Brackets

The GS SHOP brackets are the primary graphic element for the brand. The brackets represent The Real Deal and are essential to our expression. The brackets are taken from the GS SHOP logo. Their primary use is to frame the real stories GS SHOP is tellingâ€”about products, people and experiences we offer. As a secondary use, the brackets create a pattern or texture.

### Clear Space

A clear area around the GS SHOP logo will ensure it has maximum visibility and impact in every communication. The clear space is based on the width and height of the brackets when extending from all four sides of the logo.

### Minimum Size

When reproducing the GS SHOP logo, be sure to maintain the minimum size for consistency and legibility.

## Usage

### General Rules

The brackets should only be used to frame products, people and experiences associated with GS SHOP.

### Overlap

With cutout photography only one set of brackets should be used to frame the story. If the image overlaps the brackets, they should still be easily recognizable.

### Crop

Again, only one set of brackets should be used to frame the story. If the brackets are cropped out of the frame, they should still be easily recognizable.

### Context

When used with contextual photography, the brackets should be in a color that complements the image. No more than six sets of brackets should be used on a single image.

## Color : Logo

When the logo is used in color, everything but the brackets will be set in earth brown. The dark brown creates contrast for the brighter colored brackets. This allows the brackets to stand out as the primary graphic element and become recognizable when removed from the logotype.
